INSTALL for ProBIND

This document will guide you through installing ProBIND.

This is a step-by-step procedure for getting started with ProBIND.
In the examples, I will assume that your Apache document root is in
/www/htdocs, and that the stand-alone PHP interpreter is installed as
/usr/local/bin/php


Prerequisites
-------------

The following minimum software versions are required for running ProBIND:
- MySQL 3.23
- PHP 5.2.0
- Apache 1.3 (or nginx)
- Perl 5.005
- David Beveridge's phplib

If you wish to use the development version of the interface, you'll also need:
- PHPExcel via PEAR

For pushing updates with the included scripts, the following additional
software is required:
- OpenSSH
- rsync

To run consistency checks, the following additional software is required:
- Perl 5.005 or newer
- Net::DNS Perl module (installable through CPAN)

For running the bulk import script, the following additional software is
required:
- PHP CLI binary (NOT CGI)
- Console_Getopt PEAR package (this comes by default with PHP PEAR) 

If you run PHP as an Apache module, you must also have the CGI version
installed for some scripts to work.


1. Preparation
--------------

WARNING: Due to the nature of ProBIND, your Apache user will need to have
higher permission levels than normal for a public webserver. It is HIGHLY
RECOMMENDED to keep ProBIND on a non-public server or at least isolate it and
monitor access to the server closely.  

If you are switching to ProBIND from an existing configuration, make sure to
have current backups of your existing DNS setup.


2. Installation
---------------

Initial Install of ProBIND
--------------------------
Unpack the ProBIND tarball somewhere that is reachable by your Apache 
server. Usually, this would be in a directory in the document root for
your Apache installation, e.g. /www/htdocs/probind. Change to this
directory.

Installation of PHP and Excel Modules in PEAR
---------------------------------------------

Make sure these (or similar) are installed. (In cPanel use EasyApache)
# yum install php-mbstring php-gd php-imap php-xml php-snmp php-mysql php-mcrypt

New installation:
# pear channel-discover pear.pearplex.net
# pear install pearplex/PHPExcel

Or if you've already installed PHPExcel before:
# pear upgrade pearplex/PHPExcel

Configuring MySQL
-----------------
Now you must create a MySQL database instance. The name of the database 
instance is not important, so pick something descriptive, e.g. 'probind'. 
You should also create a MySQL user for ProBIND.

NOTE: You are not required to run MySQL on the same server as Apache.

Once the database is created, you will need to load the initial database
structure. You can do this by loading etc/mktables.sql and
etc/new-phplib-tables.sql files into the MySQL database you just created.

Example: 
$ mysql -u probinduser -p probind < etc/mktables.sql
$ mysql -u probinduser -p probind < etc/new-phplib-tables.sql

Configuring ProBIND
-------------------
There are two steps to configuring ProBIND. The initial step is to edit the
config.php file with your database information. The config.php file is a small
PHP script that holds the information for ProBIND's operation. It holds
directory settings and database information and resides in the "inc" directory.

Copy the config.tmpl.php file to config.php and open config.php in a text
editor. It contains several settings which you must edit to reflect your
installation:

$TOP
  This is the directory you unpacked ProBIND in, e.g /www/htdocs/probind
$MYSQL_HOST
	The host where MySQL is running, e.g. "localhost". 
$MYSQL_DB
	The name of the MySQL database, e.g. "probind".
$MYSQL_USER
	The MySQL username that ProBIND should use to log into MySQL.
$MYSQL_PASSWD
	The MySQL password that ProBIND should use to log into MySQL.

We now have the database and application ready, but we still don't have an
user. To create one, edit check_db_access.php to choose your desired username
and password, and then run that script. Don't forget to remove your username or
at least your password from the script afterwards.
	
At this point, you can load the ProBIND web interface. The final step for a
working ProBIND configuration is described in the next section.


3. Configuring Settings
-----------------------

Click the 'Misc. tools' link in the top frame. Then select 'Settings' in the
sub-menu that appears.  Fill out the top four fields according to your needs
and click the 'Update settings' button.


4. Adding BIND DNS Servers
--------------------------

Now you must tell the database about your BIND servers. Click 'Servers'
on the submenu. Add a description for each server you wish to manage
through the ProBIND interface. For each server, you must specify its
hostname, an IP number and some supplemental information that ProBIND
needs: If the server is used as a master or slave server, whether it
should receive updates from ProBIND, and whether the server should 
appear in NS records for the domains managed by ProBIND. The latter
two settings makes it possible to use ProBIND e.g. while you are
migrating a BIND server from one host to another, or deals with
a dual-interface server that must receive updates through one interface,
but speaks with the outside world on another.

Three fields in the server description are used when delivering an
update to the server. The first field tells ProBIND where the zonefiles
exist on the server, e.g. /var/named. NB: ProBIND expects that the
named.conf file exists in the same directory as the zone files. You may
have to create a symlink in /etc to /var/named/named.conf to alleviate
this. Also NB: All files in this directory are subject to being completely
rewritten/overwritten/deleted by ProBIND. If you have some interesting
hacks in your named.conf, be sure to put them into the ProBIND template
file before you update the BIND server.

You must also specify a template for the named.conf file on the
server. Template files must be located in the etc directory of the
ProBIND installation. A template consists of all the BIND configurations 
which are not zone declarations, see the sample master.tmpl file 
included in the distribution. The template is also where you put
your BIND options.

Finally, you must specify a script that will copy zonefiles to the
BIND server, and then restart the BIND server. This script must exist
in the sbin directory of ProBIND installation. See the push scripts
included in the distribution, they are based on rsync/openssh for secure
access to the BIND server host. If you want to try out ProBIND without
risk to your servers, specify the included 'nop' script in this field.


5. Start using ProBIND
----------------------

At this point you should click 'Browse domains' and flesh out the
TEMPLATE pseudo-domain. If you have some data which should apply
to all your domains, add it now. This might include TXT or MX
records which all your domains should contain. 

NOTE: DO NOT ADD ANY NS RECORDS TO YOUR TEMPLATE! NS records for your
servers are automatically generated by ProBIND. You control how the 
NS records are generated when you describe your BIND servers.

You are now ready to populate the database. You can do this manually, 
or you can use the etc/import script to load an existing BIND configuration
with zone files into the database. 


6. Using the import script
--------------------------

You probably already have a BIND installation that you want to streamline
the management of. Otherwise you would not be looking at this program.
The good news is that there is a small PHP script included with ProBIND,
etc/import, which automates the task of converting BIND named.conf and
zone files to ProBIND database entries. 

To import your BIND configuration, copy named.conf and all of your zone 
files into a directory on your ProBIND host. 

Then execute this command:

/www/htdocs/probind/etc/import -v $PWD/named.conf | tee import.log

Note the $PWD prefix on the filename. Due to a peculiarity of PHP
as a stand-alone interpreter, it is necessary to specify the full
path to the source file.

Review the import log and the database carefully. You do not want to
update your BIND servers until your are confident that the database
accurately represents your DNS data.

If you have a lot of comments in your zone files, run import with the -a
flag too (i.e. import -av $PWD/named.conf). That way the unaltered text of 
a zone file is put into the ProBIND database as a comment text for the zone.


7. Update the BIND servers
--------------------------

When you are satisfied with the contents, click the 'Update' link to
generate the zone files and distribute them to the servers. You can
inspect the zone files generated in the tmp/master directory in the
ProBIND installation.

If you want to see what ProBIND would do to your servers, without actually
letting it touch them, specify the "nop" update script in the BIND server
descriptions. This will let ProBIND generate all the files it thinks are
needed on your BIND server, but not actually copy them. You can examine
the generated files in the tmp/master and tmp/slave directories.

NOTE: The "push" scripts included use rsync to copy files from the ProBIND
server to the BIND servers. This assumes that openssh trust relationships
have been set up between the ProBIND computer and the BIND servers. 


8. Troubleshooting
-------------------

Web server configuration
------------------------
Your web server must have write access to several directories in order
to write the named.conf and zone files. Either chown the tmp dir to
whichever userid web server is running under, or chmod it to mode 01777.
Either way, make sure that it is empty before running your first update!

Another way updates can fail is if the PHP interpreter is configured
for safe_mode. ProBIND relies on several external program for tasks
like generating zone files, updating BIND servers and making specialized
queries against external name servers. ProBIND is not currently compatible
with safe_mode.

Pushing updates/using rsync/ssh
-------------------------------
The sample "push" scripts depend on rsync to copy files from your ProBIND
server to one or more BIND servers. This means that your web server user 
must somehow be allowed to copy files to the name server user on the BIND
server, without password prompts.
 
An example to illustrate this: ProBIND is installed under an Apache server
running under userid nobody on host foo.example.com. BIND is running
under userid root on host bar.example.com. The problem is that a very
untrusted user (nobody@foo.example.com) needs to upload data to 
root@bar.example.com, and reload the name server. Additionally, SSH insists
on having a home directory so it can keep a database of keys in ~/.ssh.

There are several ways around this: 
1)Make apache on foo run under a more privileged user id (e.g. root)
2) Make $TOP/sbin/push setuid to a more privileged user id
3) Give the nobody user a home directory with write access

The best option among these is 1, but this is dependant on the situation.

One an option above, or similar option is chosen, the following steps need
to be taken:
  
1)  Make this more privileged trusted by root on bar. This is as easy
as appending the /root/.ssh/identity.pub file from foo to /root/.ssh/known_hosts
on bar. (or id_dsa.pub to known_hosts2).

2)  Verify that you can ssh from root@foo to root@bar without being prompted 
for a password.
